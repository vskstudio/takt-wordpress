# Takt Analytics for WordPress

## 0.3.2

- **Ingest origin**: the server-to-server setting is an *origin* — `takt-core-php`
  appends `/api/event` on every send — but nothing stopped an admin from pasting
  the full collect URL, which is the form documented everywhere on the snippet
  side (`https://taktlytics.com/api/event`). The request then went to
  `/api/event/api/event` and failed silently; since the order is claimed before
  the send, the purchase was lost for good. Both forms are now accepted: a
  trailing `/api/event` is folded back to its origin. Settings already stored are
  origins and go through unchanged.
- The settings field is renamed **Origine d'ingestion** and spells out which of
  the two URLs it expects.
- Docs: the settings reference now lists the 19 settings with their real
  defaults (**Exclure localhost** is off on a fresh install, not on), names the
  actual tagged-events selector (`[data-takt-event]`, with `data-takt-prop-*`
  properties), separates the ingest origin from the snippet's collect URL, and
  no longer suggests Takt can be self-hosted — it is a managed service hosted in
  Europe, and only the measurement script can be served from your own domain.
  `readme.txt` also regains the changelog entries it was missing since 0.1.0.

## 0.3.1

- Harden the **Excluded paths** sanitizer: anchor the path pattern with `\z`
  so a trailing newline can no longer slip through.

## 0.3.0

- New **Excluded paths** setting: a comma-separated list of path prefixes
  (e.g. `/app, /account`) that the browser tracker never records. This is a
  privacy control backed by the tracker's `exclude` option and is therefore
  **SDK-mode only** — it is silently dropped in the inline / CDN / asset modes,
  where `takt-core-php` would otherwise throw.
- Require `vskstudio/takt-core-php` `^0.5.0`, which adds the `exclude` option.

## 0.2.0

### Hardening

- WooCommerce: the order is now claimed (the `_takt_tracked` guard is marked and
  saved) **before** the Purchase event is sent, not after, so a re-entrant status
  hook (processing→completed, a plugin re-saving the order, a double admin click)
  counts a purchase at most once.
- Require `vskstudio/takt-core-php` `^0.3.2`, pulling in the S2S header
  sanitization (CR/LF stripped from the forwarded buyer IP/User-Agent and the
  API key), the numeric `Revenue` amount validation, and the re-bundled inline
  tracker.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release: injects the privacy-first Takt browser snippet into
  `wp_head` (inline / CDN / hosted-asset / SDK modes) and reports WooCommerce
  purchases as server-to-server events.
